# Hi, I'm Seth ðŸ‘‹ Software Developer @ The Architects :rocket:

## :mortar_board: A little bit about me
I am a member of an amazing team called The Architects. I have a passion for building fully responsive user interfaces that don't leave users confused. I strive to keep code DRY and reusable, as well as learn new technologies along the way. I'm currently working with React, Typescript, Node, GraphQL / Apollo, and Next.js.
