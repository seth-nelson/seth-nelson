# Go touch some grass fellow devs! üìê

## üîé 
I am a full stack engineer by trade, but front end engineer by passion. I have been consulting for many different projects over the last 3 years including full stack government apps, mobile applications, social accountability applications, commercial widgets, and marketing sites. My current tech stack is React utilizing Gatsby + Graphql running Wordpress CMS. I am always up for learning something new and staying curious, especially in the security and hardware sector. Shoot me a message if you have a fun project you're working on!
